## Reporting a Vulnerability

### Where to report
You can report a vulnerability by creating a new [issue](https://github.com/aName2050/aOS-Web/issues) and attaching the `Security` tag.

### Our process
Once you submit a security vulnerability, we follow these steps:
- Investigation
  -  We begin an investigation, following your steps to try and reproduce it.
- Evaluation
  - We evaluate the severity of the issue, if it is a high severity or actively exploited, we remove the issue from the `Issues` tab to ensure more bad actors don't learn about it.
  - We create a copy of the vulnerability in the `Security` tab as an adisory with limited information till it is resolved
- Resolution
  - Once identified, we begin right away on a patch. A patch will usually be available within a few hours to days. These updates will be suffixed with `-S`.
